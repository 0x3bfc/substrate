//! Primitive traits for providing election functionality.
//!
//! This crate provides two traits that could potentially be implemented by two struct. The struct
//! receiving the functionality election could potentially implement [`ElectionDataProvider`] and
//! the struct providing the election functionality implements [`ElectionProvider`].

/// Something that can provide the data to something else that implements [`ElectionProvider`], such

///
/// The underlying purpose of this is to provide auxillary data to long-lasting election providers.
/// For example, the [`two_phase`] election provider needs to know the voters/targets list well in
/// advance and before a call to [`ElectionProvider::elect`].
///
/// For example, if pallet A wants to use the two-phase election:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// pub trait TraitA {
///     type ElectionProvider: ElectionProvider<_, _>;
/// }
///
/// // these function will be called by `Self::ElectionProvider` whenever needed.
/// impl ElectionDataProvider for PalletA { /* ..  */ }
///
/// impl<T: TraitA> Module<T> {
///     fn do_election() {
///         // finalize the election.
///         T::ElectionProvider::elect( /* .. */ );
///     }
/// }
/// ```

	/// or may not be used. To hint about this to the call site, [`NEEDS_ELECT_DATA`] should be
